All of this based on attributes of the customer and other attributes of the company purchase offers.

## Files 

This repo contains 4 files. 

1.  My project: 'Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb'.
  
The data used in this project is contained in:

2. portfolio.json
3. profile.json
4. transcript.json

## Conclusion

The most occuring event is 'offer_received', so I tried to do a model with that, but  the results of the model seems like not so good . There is no change in rate of accuracy it keep constant.
